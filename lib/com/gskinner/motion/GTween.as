Visit www.gskinner.com/libraries/gtween/ for documentation, updates and more free code. Licensed under the MIT license - see the source file header for more information.</b>	* <hr>	* GTween is a light-weight instance oriented tween engine. This means that you instantiate tweens for specific purposes, and then reuse, update or discard them.	* This is different than centralized tween engines where you "register" tweens with a global object. This provides a more familiar and useful interface	* for object oriented programmers.	* <br/><br/>	* In addition to a more traditional setValue/setValues tweening interface, GTween also provides a unique proxy interface to tween and access properties of target objects	* in a more dynamic fashion. This allows you to work with properties directly, and mostly ignore the details of the tween. The proxy "stands in"	* for your object when working with tweened properties. For example, you can modify end values (the value you are tweening to), in the middle of a tween.	* You can also access them dynamically, like so:	* <br/><br/>	* <code>mySpriteTween.proxy.rotation += 50;</code>	* <br/><br/>	* Assuming no end value has been set for rotation previously, the above example will get the current rotation from the target, add 50 to it, set it as the end	* value for rotation, and start the tween. If the tween has already started, it will adjust for the new values. This is a hugely powerful feature that	* requires a bit of exploring to completely understand. See the documentation for the "proxy" property for more information.	* <br/><br/>	* For a light-weight engine (<3.5kb), GTween boasts a number of advanced features:<UL>	* <LI> frame and time based durations/positions which can be set per tween	* <LI> works with any numeric properties on any object (not just display objects)	* <LI> simple sequenced tweens using .nextTween	* <LI> pause and resume individual tweens or all tweens	* <LI> jump directly to the end or beginning of a tween with .end() or .beginning()	* <LI> jump to any arbitrary point in the tween with .position	* <LI> complete, init, and change callbacks	* <LI> smart garbage collector interactions (prevents collection while active, allows collection if target is collected)	* <LI> uses any standard ActionScript tween functions	* <LI> easy to set up in a single line of code	* <LI> can repeat or reflect a tween a specified number of times	* <LI> deterministic, so setting a position on a tween will (almost) always result in predictable results	* <LI> very powerful sequencing capabilities in conjunction with GTweenTimeline.	* </UL>	*	* <hr/>	* <b>Version 2 Notes (Oct 2, 2009):</b><br/>	* GTween version 2 constitutes a complete rewrite of the library. This version	* is 20% smaller than beta 5 (<3.5kb), it performs up to 5x faster, adds timeScale functionality,	* and supports a simple but robust plug-in model. The logic and source is also much	* simpler and easy to follow.	**/	public class GTween {			// Constants:			// Static interface:		/**		* Setting this to true pauses all tween instances.
